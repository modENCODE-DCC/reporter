changes need to be made:
the database name host, username, password, etc.
the geo submission username, password, etc.

the code accepts an experiment id, a report dir for writing out all files.

the normalized datafile name is automatically created from chado.
the raw datafile name is the same as the submitted, this need to be changed to whatever place the submission pipelines put them to.

the code will create a tar ball and use the geo submission page to submit.
